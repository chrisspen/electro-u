    Electric Lifting Magnet Holding Electromagnet Lift 5Kg 6V DC 4W 0.68A

=> 0.68/6*5 = x = 0.56A => 5*0.56 = 2.8W

Tested by powering with a 5V/3A UBEC.
Measured current usage of 0.64A. => 5*0.64 = 3.2W
Could attract a 9.5mm bearing from the rim of the magnet.
Within a minute, the unit had a temperature of 90-95 degrees F.
